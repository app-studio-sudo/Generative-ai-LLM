# Security Policy

### Impact

We are introducing a proposed Developer Incentive Program aimed at rewarding contributors who identify and responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities within GitHub repositories and projects.

Program Overview:
Eligibility: Any developer, programmer, or contributor who discovers and reports a valid security vulnerability following GitHub’s responsible disclosure policies.
Reward: Each verified and successfully reviewed vulnerability report will earn the reporter 500 tokens, which will be applied toward their GitHub Copilot Free Tier quota.
Purpose: This incentive encourages proactive security engagement, strengthens the GitHub ecosystem, and acknowledges the critical work of developers who help protect our community.

Impact Statement:
By offering a tangible reward for verified vulnerability reports, we aim to:
Encourage timely and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.
Recognize and compensate developers for their efforts in improving security.
Build a stronger, more secure collaborative environment for all GitHub users.

Submission and Review:
Vulnerability reports must be submitted through GitHub’s official security reporting channels.
Each report will be reviewed for accuracy and impact.
Upon acceptance, the contributor will receive the token credit toward their Copilot Free Tier usage.

This initiative represents our commitment to developer recognition and community-driven security improvements. Your participation strengthens GitHub for everyone.
